# Welcome to [Astro](https://astro.build)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of the Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/React components.

`src/layout` has elements like html,meta,header tags and things which are common to many pages.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |

| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |

## Commit History
1. Using JS inside Astro Files - Similar to React (We can also directly use React/Vue etc components inside if we download their corresponding package)

2. Making Layout component which will be common to our pages and contains the html/meta/header tags. We also learnt how {children} works here - it is called [`<slot>`](./src/layouts/Layout.astro#L32) in Astro. We also learnt how props are used and propTypes syntax in Astro [refer](./src/layouts/Layout.astro#L4).

3. Learnt how to integrate UI framework (in our case React) and use it in Astro. Refer [docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/).

4. Learnt to add JS actions in Astro. Its the same as vanilla JS. Add `<script></script>` tag and inside it write vanilla js logic. We can also attach variables to script which can also be props received ([refer](./src/components/Tabs.astro#L48))

5. Routing is similar to **NextJs**, where fileName in pages folder becomes the route name. For eg: `pages/about.astro` leads to **/about** route.
